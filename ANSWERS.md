1. What are PropTypes used for?
    PropTypes are used to type check the data being passed to a component. Since JavaScript has dynamic typing, you can pass a number when you're actually trying to pass a string and your code will run just fine. Using PropTypes makes it so that if you're passing the a number instead of a string, you receive a warning in the console.
