1. What are PropTypes used for?
    PropTypes are used for type-checking in React. They allow you to specify the expectations surrounding a received prop. For example, you can use them to describe the expected element type (array, object, string, etc.) and whether the prop is optional or required. Type-checking helps developers narrow prop specificity and locate type deviations. 

2. What is a lifecycle event in React?
    A lifecycle event refers to a specific milestone within a componentâ€™s lifespan. The three most common phases are the mounting (birth), updating (growth), and unmounting (death) phases. These phases and the phase transitions between them can be leveraged to trigger specific actions when they occur (eg. state being updated before a component unmounts).

3. What is a Higher Order Component?
    A Higher Order Component is a function that receives a component as an argument and returns a component based on its logic. This high-level pattern enhances component reusability by minimizing repetition of similar components.
