What are three different ways to style components in React? Explain some of the benefits of each.

You can use the styled components library to style your app. Very powerful. Using inline styles is also effective in react. And there is always the classic stylesheet you can use. Styling within your component keeps your codebase clean since you dont need a stylesheet for every component and it is the way i prefer to do things in most cases. Still getting usedto it though
