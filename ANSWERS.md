1. What are PropTypes used for?

2. What is a lifecycle event in React?
   * A class component inherits what are known as `lifecycle methods` that you can use to write code that gets executed at particular phases during the process of a component's lifecycle, from birth(mounting) to death(unmounting). In this way, you can control what happens when each part of your app renders, updates, thinks about re-rendering, and then unmounts completely.

3. What is a Higher Order Component?
   * Generally speaking, a `Higher Order Component` is a function that takes in a component as an argument and returns a new component. It basically transforms a component into another component with added functionality. An HOC is usually used in React to share common functionality between components without repeating code, thus making your code DRYer.

4. What are three different ways to style components in React?
