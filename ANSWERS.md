1. Proptypes are used to quite literally save your life when creating a react application. What Proptypes are used for is to make sure the data you get passed is valid, essentially type-checking the data that gets passed in. For example, if we specify a property of "name" should be expecting a string (via name:PropTypes.string), and we pass in a boolean value accidentally, PropTypes will save us and display an error telling us we used an "unexpected" data value since a string is not the same as a boolean.

2. A lifecycle event in React refers to when the components get mounted to the DOM, when the components get updated, and when they're unmounted. 

3. A higher order component is a component that takes in another component as its argument and returns a new one! They're great for reusing a component's logic instead of repeating it all over again.

4. The three ways you can install components with React is through: CSS, styled components, and inline styling (yuck).
