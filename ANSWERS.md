1) What are PropTypes used for?
They are a way to keep track of and validate what data types should be passed down through which components.  
2)What is a lifecycle event in React?
It's a function that can be accessed at the stage between the mounting and unmounting of a component in order to trigger certain actions at specific times of an App and its component's lifecycles; things like API calls, and deactivating event listeners on unmount, etc.   
3)What is a Higher Order Component? A higher order component is a component that takes another component as its props and can be used to modify the style of the component or execute some kind of logic sequence involving it. 


4)What are three different ways to style components in React? You could use vanilla CSS, CSS Modules, or Styled Components. I predict in some distant or near future we also may be able to swish VR code wands around and do a little styling.
