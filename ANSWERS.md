- [ ] What are three different ways to style components in React? Explain some of the benefits of each.

Three ways to style in React are: Styled Components, Vanilla CSS, and Bootstrap/ReactStrap.

Styled Components is a library that allows the developer to write inline css syntax inside of a Component. This is very fast and efficient.

Vanilla CSS styling is used by importing an external CSS file and writing all styling within said file. This is useful for quick experimentation since the developer doesn't need to install any external libraries.

BootStrap/ReactStrap is a library with a large database of pre-written CSS code. This allows the developer to create professional looking designs in a fraction of the time compared to doing it from scratch.
