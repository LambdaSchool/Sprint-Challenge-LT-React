1. Proptypes: PropTypes are simply a developer tool that allows the developer to typecheck props in a component. To make sure that proper props are passed through each component, PropTypes throws a warning when any data type other than the declared data type is passed through the Component.

2. Lifecycle event: Lifecycle events are seperate stages of a React component. The lifecycle methods are hooks that we can use to grab into the React component at the given event. With lifecycle events, we always have a guaranteed time of when certain events can occur. This gives us predictability and simplicity for writing complex code that depends on certain events to take place before it's executed.

3. Higher Order Component: Higher Order Components are components that take a component as an argument and return a component. They're sort of like Higher Order functions in that sense. A component transforms props into UI, but a higher order component transforms a component into another component.

4. 3 ways to style React components: Creating a styles object and passing it in as a `style` prop. CSS-in-JS (a library like styled components), and CSS stylesheets, usually done in association with the components themselves.
