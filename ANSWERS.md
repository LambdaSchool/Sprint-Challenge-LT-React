### Questions & Answers:

1.  What are PropTypes used for?
    PropTypes are used for type validation during development to catch and prevent bugs when passing data to and through components.

2.  What is a lifecycle event in React?
    In React, there are three 'lifecycle events' in the life of a component. Those are: Mount, Update, and Unmount; phrased without jargon, these life events are: birth, change, and death. In a general sense, a lifecycle event is just the moment when one of those three things happen to a component and one can be utilized through one of their unique lifecycle methods, or hooks.

3.  What is a Higher Order Component?
    A Higher Order *Anything* seems like a thing that takes a thing of its own type and creates a thing of its own type, but with some additional functionality. A Higher Order Banana would be a Banana that, when given a Banana, creates a Super Banana.

    Jokes aside, a Higher Order Component is a component that takes a component as an argument, adds funtionality or meaning, and returns a new component composed of the original component and the additional funtionality or meaning.  
    
4.  What are three different ways to style components in React?
    The three ways to style components in React that I can think of are: 1. Using CSS, 2. Using a CSS pre-processor (like LESS, SASS or SCSS), 2. Using Styled Components.
