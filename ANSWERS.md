**2.  What is a lifecycle event in React?** 

A lifecycle event is one which takes place independenetly of the page loading. ComponentDidMount() is a good example of this, and we can use it to call event listeners, or add data we didn't want to use the DOM for. We can also take the data away if needs be, with ComponentDidUnmount().

A higher order component takes _another_ component in as a parameter, creating a more powerful component (in the sense of the specific actions we can use it for).
