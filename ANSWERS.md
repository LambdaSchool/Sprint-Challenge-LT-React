3. What is a Higher Order Component?

4. What are three different ways to style components in React?


<!-- Answers -->

1. PropTypes are used for checking the types of incoming data for a component.

2. A lifecycle event is a singled-out occurence in React; for example, `componentDidMount`.

3. A HOC is a component which takes another component as an argument.

4. You can style using plain CSS in .css, using CSS in .js (styled-components), 
   using pre-processing(CSS in .less in my case thus far), 
   or by using some other sort of library (i.e. Bootstrap or react-strap).
