1. Proptypes are used for verification to make sure the data/function/types are being passed correctly.  It allows for the coder to see if they are any problems before they come up

2. a lifecycle in react is how the data is "mounted" and passed and the cyle it goes through to make sure the state is constatnly updated.  it also frees up the machine to use less resources so it's not boggeled down cycling data that it no longer necessary.    

3.HOC is a way for react to nest things together to reuse logic.  it allows programmers to reuse logics and code rather than having to recode it again.  - from the DOCs a component transforms props into UI a HOC transforms a component into another component.  SO rather than repeatetion it resues the same function off another component so instead of 300+ lines of code it can be dwindled down to at least half.  

4. Usual CSS, styled components, and inline.  Usual cSS allows for some to stylize completly seperatly and while it has its benefits it get a little much when you leave ALL the styling to one doc.

styled components allows for coders to "shortcut" in a sense and style on the go rather than later.  samd with in line but style components allows for seperate documentaion which leads to cleaner code, but at the same time if yuou don't know here it is exactly it can be a while hunt trying to find it.
