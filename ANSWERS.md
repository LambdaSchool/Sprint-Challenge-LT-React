 1. Props are the mechanism React uses to let components communicate with each other.
    PropTypes is a way of making runtime assertions about what type of data a React component requires in order to render properly.

 2. React lets you define components as classes or functions. The methods that you are able to use on these are called lifecycle events.
    These methods can be called during the lifecycle of a component, and they allow you to update the UI and application states.

 3. A higher-order component (HOC) is an advanced technique in React for reusing component logic.
    In that way, a higher-order component is a function that takes  a component and returns a new component.

 4. Styled-components, ReactStrap, vanilla Css/LESS or SASS preprosesors.
