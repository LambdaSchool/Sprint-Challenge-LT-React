1. PropTypes are used to validate the types of data that are passed as props through a React component. By validating this data, you can prevent future errors by ensuring that the type of data being passed through the component is the intended type.
2. A lifecycle event is a method called throughout the so-called lifecycle of a React component. These methods are called while a component is mounting, whenever a component is updated, and when a component is being unmounted from the DOM. An example is componentDidMount, which is called after a component is rendered and is often used to fetch data from an API for use elsewhere throughout the component.
3. A higher order component is a functional component which takes another component in as an argument and extends its own functionality to the component that it takes in.
4. Components can be styled by importing a CSS file into a component and then implmenting classNames throughout the component that reference the styling in the CSS file. They can also be styled using a library like Reactstrap, from  which pre-styled components can be imported into a component. Lastly, components can be styled using styled-components, allowing for styling to be written directly into the React JavaScript file.
