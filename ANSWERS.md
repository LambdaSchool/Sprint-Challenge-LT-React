In React because we are building multiple components and those components can potentially have many different props passed down to them of all different types, we use PropTypes to ensure that we are getting the specific type that we require for each prop. PropTypes specifically come in handy when working with code that is written by someone else. This is because you can easily open up a component and check which props are requires and what type they should be, and if you do happen to pass down the wrong prop you will receive an error message from the console about the wrong/missing prop. 

Life-cycle events occur on class components. They give you the ability to do certain things at certain times during the lifecyle of a component. The three stages of the lifecycle are mounting, updating and unmounting. During the mounting phase that components constructor is first ran, than that component is render, and the componentDidMount() method is ran. After the componentDidMount() method is ran the component moves to a updating phase. In the updating phase the component will re-render if it is required and then you will have access to the componenetDidUpdate() method. Finally the end of the components lifecycle is the unmounting stage where the component is unmounted and the componentWillUnmount() method is available for use.  

Higher Order Components are functions that take other components in as a parameter and then return a new and enhanced component. HOCs allow you to share common functionalities between your components without repeating code. HOCs have many use cases and few examples would be rendering a specific page based on some condition, providing components with specific styles or  managing common user-interaction states.

You can style components in React using a regular CSS file, using styled components or by using a library of some sort like BootStrap.
