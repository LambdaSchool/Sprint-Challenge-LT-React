1. PropTypes is used to check the data type of props that you are passing through your components. This way you can avoid errors that stem from unintentionally passing the wrong type of data.

2. The React Lifecycle includes Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting. There are lifecycle events, or hooks, for each of these stages that you can use to execute certain things at a specific time during the component's lifecycle (for example, using componentDidMount to set the state as soon as a component mounts on the DOM, or componenWillUnmount to take components away so they don't continue to render unnecessarily);
 
3. A Higher Order  Component takes in another component as an argument. HOCs are used to make it so that component logic is reusable.

4. Components can be styled in React using CSS files that are imported into your component files, using styled-components, or by using inline styling.
