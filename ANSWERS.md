1. PropTypes are used as a way of type checking input for a component Props. This allows React to throw an error if an unexpected type is given for a Prop, rather than continuing on with bad data.

2. A lifecycle event in React is an event that happens as a Component is first prepared to mount, and then when there are changes made to it after that, including ultimately unmounting. There are built-in React functions that allow us to run functions upon these lifecycle events.

3. A Higher Order Component is a Component that takes a component as its argument and returns a new component.

4. Components can be styled with vanilla javascript, Reactstrap, or with styled-components.
