1.) What are PropType used for? 
    Proptypes are one of the easiest methods we have to validate input, not just from a user,but within our own programs as well. They can make sure that the information passed into a component is of the right type, if there are the correct number of arguments, and if there are any arguments at all. This allows our React components to behave in a similar fashion to classical, type declared functions, while still retaining the flexibility of Javascript and React.
2.) What is a lifecycle event in React?
    A lifecycle event is a phase in a components life, or a moment when the component is either being born (mounted), lives (state, or setState) or dies (unmounts). It is a way to time certain events based on what phase certain elements in the DOM exist in. For example you wouldn't want to update th state of an element that didn't yet exist. 
3.) What is a Higher order Component
    I'll admit that I still don't truly understand this one. From what I can gather, a HOC is just a functional component which takes in other components, adds some bells and whistles and returns another component which has some new functionality. I think it should generally be a functional component because it tends to not need its own state, because it's just taking in another component and possibly some other arguments, and returning a result, much like a typical function, but I'm also not entirely positive that holds true all the time. I know there are a lot more rules involving the syntax and usage of HOC's but I really couldn't tell you them. 
4.) In React, we can first use the normal, vanilla CSS method, where we have a separate CSS      file with all our styling which we then import into our .js file. We could also use          bootstrap or react bootstrap to provide pre-built structural styles which can be easy to     plug in and use. We could also use styled components, which is a method whish utilizes       the 'styled-components' library in React to create new custom components which replace      our typical divs, spans and form tags. These React components live within the .js file       where the component they modify is, so all of our code and styling is consolidated and       easy to access. They also make our components more modular and easy to re-use, since         everything, both styling and function, are in one place, ready to be plugged into            whatever application.
