1. PropTypes are used to ensure correct type of date is being passed to state. For example, when passing a text to a paragraph, we would make sure the value isn't a number or boolean. Helps developers to ensure they don't run into issues before deploying.

2. I life-cycle event, would be for example when we initially load (Birth Phase) an application, we would set the state property with the initial data from the data base before user modifies it (Update Phase).

3. High Order Components are components that take another Component as a paramater. They work simiraly as callback functions. They can be used in Edge Casing (showing or hiding information) as well as making the code less dry (reusable components);

4. You can style React using css, pre-processes, 3rd party libraries (Bootstrap) or Styled Components (React CSS in JS). Using css or css, can be helpful when working on smaller projects, whereas styled components can be used when working on more complex projects where there is a lot of repetitive components. You can also user props to pass down in styled components. This helps writing less code.
