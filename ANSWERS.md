1. What are PropTypes used for?
  PropTypes is a roadmap for you and future developers to see what kind of data goes where. If piece of data needs to be a string. PropTypes will display a warning if the data type is anything but a string. 
2. What is a lifecycle event in React?
  A lifecycle event in React is any one of the stages a React app goes through to manipulate the data. componentDidMount, render, and componentWillUnmount are just three methods used to run React. componentDidMount will make sure things like setState will happen one time before the render is called. Render runs after many events in react so that the page will update quickly. componentWillUnmount removes things like click handlers so that 'dead' components won't interfere with other components.
3. What is a Higher Order Component?
  A higher order component is a component that takes another component as an argument.
4. What are three different ways to style components in React?
  Three different ways to style components in React are: 
    1. Vanilla css. You can style each component by importing it's own css file.
    2. Styled-components library. You can install the styled components library and treat styles like a component. You can style many elements in the components with just a few lines of code. You import the styles like any other component.
    3. You can use ReactStrap. Which is a bootstrap-like libray to style components.
