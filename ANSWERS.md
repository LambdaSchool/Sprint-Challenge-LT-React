    1) What are PropTypes used for?

PropTypes are used for validation, to make sure that props getting received by a component are of the correct type of data. PropTypes generate helpful errors in the console if props are not of the expected variety.

    2) What is a lifecycle event in React?

A lifecycle event is an Event that fires, triggering a programmed function like other Events do, at certain times in the lifecycle of a React component. The main ones include: constructor, render, and ComponentDidMount when a component is first created; render when a component's state or props change; and ComponentWillDismount when the component is about to be removed from the virtual DOM.

    3) What is a Higher Order Component?

An HOC is a component that takes another component as a parameter, and returns another component. It acts kind of like a higher-order function, in which the component that is taken as a parameter or argument is analogous to a callback function. HOCs are especially useful for conditional display of other components, letting them be turned on and off without convoluted, long ternary operators.

    4) What are three different ways to style components in React?

React components can be styled by CSS files like normal HTML; or can be built as styled components that take in a (possibly long) string of CSS code and apply it using the styled-components library's magic; or you can pass CSS properties and values as props to a component when that component is invoked.
