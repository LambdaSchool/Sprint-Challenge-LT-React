1. Proptypes are used to confirm the props a component is receiving are the type we expected (i.e number, string, array, object, etc). 
    This helps us debug and also gives future devs a quick way to see what kind of props a component is expecting.

2. A lifecyle event in react is a function that runs at certain times in a components lifecycle. These includ componentDidMount(), which runs
    after the component has mounted, componentWillUnmount(), which runs before the component unmounts, and render(), which runs anytime state or props change.

3. A higher order component is a component that takes in a component and returns another component.

4. Three different ways to style componets are inline, using vanilla css, or using styled-components.
