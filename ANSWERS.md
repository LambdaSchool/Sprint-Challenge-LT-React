# Questions:
1.What are PropTypes used for?
> PropTypes are a way for us as React Developers to catch a few more bugs before they become a problem. If our data is laid out in a specific way and passed around to components via other components, you can think of PropTypes as a way to ensure the type of data being passed around.

2.What is a lifecycle event in React?
> You can think of the lifecycle in react as a simple set of phases in a component’s life: Birth/Mounting, Growth/Updating and Death/Unmounting

3.What is a Higher Order Component?
> A Higher Order Component (HOC) is an advanced React JS pattern that allows us the capability of reusing component logic. To be more exact and put rather simply, an HOC is a function that receives a Component as an argument and returns a new component Source.
Not only can we use HOC’s for the sharing of information and functionality, we can use them to act as a container for other components, and perform some “higher level logic” checks to conditionally render a component best on some sort of variable. An example of this would be a login screen.

4.What are three different ways to style components in React?
> The three different ways to style components in React are: 1) With a .css file 2) Inline style 3) CSS in JS
