1. What are PropTypes used for?
  PropTypes are primarily used for as an extra check to make sure that data
  passed into a functional component is of the type that it should be. Because
  JS is a dynamically typed as opposed to a strongly typed language pretty much
  any piece of data can be of any type.
2. What is a lifecycle event in React?
  A lifecycle event (or method) is a method that is run somewhere within the
  timeline of a given react components initialization and the completion of its
  functioning or rendering. lifecycle methods such as render, componentDidMount
  and componentDidUpdate allow data to be passed, received and/or rendered
  at different times or under specific conditions.
3. What is a Higher Order Component?
  A higher order component is one which takes in another component and displays
  the received component conditionally. This is useful for authentication
  purposes specifically.
4. What are three different ways to style components in React?
  React components can be styled 1. With normal css via an imported css file,
  2.With a UI framework like bootstrap, or more appropriately reactstrap which
  can be imported into a project and used component-wise or 3. With styled
  components which are nice because they allow for a "CSS in JS" solution which
  saves a user the trouble of messing around with complicated file systems.
