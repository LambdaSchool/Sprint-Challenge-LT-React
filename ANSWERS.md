1.  PropTypes are used to ensure that you are passing around the right type of prop from component to component.
2.  Lifecycle methods are special methods each component can have that allow us to hook into the views when specific conditions happen (i.e. when the component first renders or when the component gets updated with new data, etc).
3.  A higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.
4.  You can style react in CSS, Styled components or inline styling.
