1. PropTypes are used for checking that the expected data types are being used.

2. A lifecycle event is when the React app state is changing in some way. Whether it's being created initially (mounting), updating itself during runtime or when a component of the app or the app itself is being discarded (unmounting).

3. Higher order components are components built out specifically to return a component bound with extra functionality which maintains it's own state with closures.

4. The three different ways to style a component are native CSS, using a UI framework like bootstrap and/or styled-components.
