1. Proptypes is a way to check the type of data being passes through props. This important in making sure all data that is being passed around and received it the correct data type. Prevents unwanted errors and make debugging easier.

2. The lifecycle is the series of steps the react app goes through when being initiated. Example: there is the mounting phase which includes the build of the constructor and the application of componentDid Mount. Next is the undating or living phase where the component can be regularly updated and rendered based on the activities of state changing, then the last phase is unmounting phase where the app is closed or unmounted and all processes end.

3. HOC are components that take in other components and house them creating functional components. As an example, they can be used for component rendering decisions like determining what components will be rendered when. 

4. External imported CSS - better organization, smaller component files. (I prefer this one :) )

Internal inline CSS - this one is good for quick styling, but can only style one element at a time so can be repetitious and impractical.

Style Components - in file styling components that can be reused but can bulk up your component files.
