1. PropTypes is a method that allows us to check and make sure that a piece of incoming data matches with a datat type that we specify within the propTypes method. We can, for example say PropTypes.string and check to see if the incoming information is a string, and if not we will recieve an error message.
2.Lifecycle events are methods that happen throughout "life events" of a component. Methods such as render and componentDidMount can happen in these life events, which include the mounting(birth), updating(life), and unmounting(death) stages of our component.
3.A higher order component is a component that takes in another component(s) as an argument and spits out a new component. It is reausable and allows us to add common elements such as state-fulness to multiple components, all while keeping our code DRY.
4.Imported CSS- the way in which we have been writing styling for most of this course. We link an external CSS file into our JS or HTML file.
Inline w/ library- We can use UI libraries such as Bootstrap to load pre-dsegined and styled components into our code. We can also used assigned values within those libraries to style our components.
Styled Components- Much in the same way we write reusable components, we can do the same with styles. By bringing in styled-components, we can create a JSX element(div, img, etc), style it using actual CSS, and then add that element variable to our components and reuse them anywhere else that we have imported them.
