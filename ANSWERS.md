1. PropTypes is used to make sure the data being passed to your components is of a specific type. This helps make sure you can catch when the data contains an error, and also pinpoints exactly what the problem is (ex: expecting a string and receives a number)

2)react LifeCycle events refer to the stages a component goes through its 'life cycles' of mounting to the DOM (birth), being updated through some fashion (growth), or un-mounting (death). these events help dictated when specific methods like componentDidMount or componentWillUnmount can be called to affect the component in some way

3)Higher order components are an advanced pattern in react. they are components that take in other components as an argument and return components, allowing different instances of state to exist in the returned components that allows them to act differently

4. you can style react components with CSS like in a vanilla Js app, with themed component libraries such as Reactstrap, or with reusable, functional styling components with styled-components
