## Questions:

1.  What are PropTypes used for?

2.  What is a lifecycle event in React?

3.  What is a Higher Order Component?

4.  What are three different ways to style components in React?

## Answers:

1.  PropTypes are used as a way to handle errors in React. Proptypes let you specify what type of data you are expecting and will throw an error message if there is a mismatch between what is expected and not expected.

2.  Lifecycle events involve phases that occur within React (mounting, updating, and unmounting) and you can attach specific event handlers to these phases. These can be use to override run code.

3.  Higher Order Component, or HOC, is a component that uses another component as an argument in the same way a HOF uses another function as an arg.

4.  Styled-components, css, less (if you install, same with styled-components).
